- Excludes development files
- Creates a self-contained zip file

## Offline Functionality

- No external CDN dependencies
- All libraries included locally
- Mock Poki SDK for offline compatibility
- Local asset loading

## Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm start

# Build Chrome extension

npm run clean
```
